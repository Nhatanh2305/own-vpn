## openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS and Fedora.

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`apt install git && git clone https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install.git && cd openvpn-install/ && chmod +x ./openvpn-install.sh && ./openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

### I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
